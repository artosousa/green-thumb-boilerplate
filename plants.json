		"about": "Amaryllis hippeastrum are bulb flowering type plants that produce a cluster of attractive trumpet like flowers in different color variation.",
		"care" : {
			"temp" : "The amaryllis within the growing period (winter - spring) prefers temperatures of 70 - 75F°f (21 - 24°c) and from September - November (or early December) 55°f (13°c). After the plant as flowered the temperature can be kept at around 70 - 75F°f (21 - 24°c) which will keep the flower healthier longer.",
			"light" : "Bright light without too much direct sunlight is preferable.",
			"watering" : "During the growing and flowering period, water when the top inch of the soil becomes dry. Once the leaves are cut away you can stop watering for about 8 – 10 weeks (dormant period) or water sparingly until new growth appears. When new leaves appear water frequently again when the top inch of soil becomes dry. Overwatering may cause the bulb to rot.",
			"soil" : "You can use equal part perlite and peat or two parts loam soil and one part perlite. Your local garden store will offer other suitable options as well.",
			"repotting" : "Your hippeastrum can be re-potted if the bulb seems to have outgrown the pot or every 2 years just before the dormant growing period (Nov - Dec). The pot size needs to be approximatively 2 inches wider each side of the bulb.",
			"ferilizer" : "After the dormant period (Nov -Dec) begin feeding with a liquid fertilizer once every 2 weeks once you begin to see leaf shoots appearing. Continue until the leaves are cut down ready for the dormant period (Sept - Nov).",
			"humidity" : "Normal room humidity is fine."

		"about": "The Angel wing begonia is a flowering species from a large family of plants (2000 or more and many more hybrids), named Begoniaceae.",
		"care" : {
			"temp" : "Average room temperatures of 55 - 75°F (13 - 24°C) are best suited for Begonias...and no less than 55°F.",
			"light" : "This plant is not in favor of direct sun. This is because the leaves are sensitive to getting scorched. In their natural habitat most Begonias grow under cover. Bright light is best and during the winter some morning or late afternoon sun is fine.",
			"watering" : "From spring - fall you will need to water this plant often, especially while it's in bloom. Keep the soil moist to the touch slightly, but do not overwater. During winter cut down watering and allow the top soil to become dry to the touch before watering again.",
			"soil" : "African Violet ready made potting soil works well. Otherwise use a rich soilless well draining potting mix.",
			"repotting" : "While the plant is young I would repot every year in a pot slightly bigger. Once it matures every 2 years. Clay pots work well because they tend to release moisture easier, preventing root problems from stagnant water. An added benefit of using a clay pot is it will keep the plant more sturdy once it matures in height and prevent it from toppling over.",
			"ferilizer" : "From spring - fall feed the plant while the soil is damp every 2 weeks. Use a high potassium diluted feed of 5-10-5. This seems to work well in keeping the leaves and flowers looking healthy.",
			"humidity" : "This plant enjoys a good amount of humidity. You can mist around the plant area, but I advise you not to water the leaves in case it causes spots or patches on them."

			"light" : "This plant requires partial shade to full sun. Make certain it can get enough light from the pot location.",
			"watering" : "Hymenocallis littoralis demands wet conditions all year long. The bulbs can be started in nothing except water, but need to be moved to soil once they begin to sprout. Soil should be kept moist, but never soggy. Do not allow standing water in the saucer underneath.",
			"soil" : "These plants prefer a standard potting soil mixed with bark or pumice at a 1:1 ratio. The pH of the soil chosen needs to be between 5.0 and 7.5 for the continued health of the plant.",
			"repotting" : "Every two years, this plant requires re-potting and an infusion of new soil. Move the plant to a size larger pot, and mix in new soil to fill the gaps. This should be done when the plant is not flowering.",
			"ferilizer" : "You may fertilize your plant once every two weeks with a diluted balanced fertilizer. Seaweed based fertilizers have been reported to produce the best results.",
			"humidity" : "This plant is happy with normal air humidity, as long as its soil is properly moist. If the soil has been allowed to dry out, the leaves and flowers may be misted with a spray bottle to combat dehydration effects."
